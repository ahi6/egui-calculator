This repo contains a calculator I wrote in rust with [egui](https://egui.rs) for a high school coding project, with its own [Shunting yard algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting_yard_algorithm) implementation.

It compiles to desktop and web platforms. (via `cargo run`/`cargo build` for desktop and `trunk serve`/`trunk build --release` for web). It also retains its state and history.

This repo is also related to my [Shunting yard algorithm visualization](https://github.com/ahi6/shunting_yard_visualization) repo. My writing about the project is available in Czech: https://github.com/ahi6/pokrocila-kalkulacka-seminarka
